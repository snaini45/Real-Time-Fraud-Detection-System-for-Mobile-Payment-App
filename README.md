# Real-Time-Fraud-Detection-System-for-Mobile-Payment-App
Overview

The Real-Time Fraud Detection System is designed to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in a mobile payment application using machine learning models and real-time data processing techniques.

Objectives

Detect Fraudulent Transactions: Use machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

Real-Time Analysis: Implement a streaming pipeline for real-time detection and alerts.

Model Evaluation: Compare different models and select the most effective one for fraud detection.

Scalability: Ensure the system can handle high transaction volumes.

Datasets

Transaction Dataset: Contains details of transactions including amount, time, location, and user behavior.

Fraud Labels: Historical data labeling transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

Tools and Libraries

Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM

Streaming Tools: Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming

Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL

Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing:

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze transaction patterns using statistical and visual techniques.

Identify common features of fraudulent transactions.

3. Model Development:

Train different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM).

Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

Optimize hyperparameters using grid search.

4. Real-Time Detection Pipeline:

Integrate Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion.

Use Spark Streaming to process transactions in real time.

Implement alerts for suspicious transactions.

5. Model Evaluation:

Use metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Compare the performance of different models and select the best one.
